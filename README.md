# Folder structure

> the idea behind the folder `lib` is implementing the FACADE pattern

> the idea behind the folder `services` is integration with APIs (login ...)

> the idea behind the folder `features` https://youtu.be/UUga4-z7b6s?t=721

```
features
|___________ todos
            |_______components
            |_______services
            |_______assets
            |_______utils
            |_______hooks
            |_______lib
            |_______ ...
            |_______ index.ts (to export what's needed)

it's just like the src folder (but many folders are optional)

# Debugging Events

-   You can see event handlers in console using `getEventListeners($0)`
-   or `monitorEvents($0, <event name> | <event name>[])` (verifying) once you finish use `unmonitorEvents` or refresh the page
-   but before inspect the target element so you can have `$0` as your target
-   Also it's possible to see event handlers in the `Elements > event Listners` tab
